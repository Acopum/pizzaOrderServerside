                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhat the pepperoni did you just salami about me, you little bread roll? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my culinary class at the Manitoban eXtreme Cooking School
                for the Cheese-Crusted, and I’ve been involved in numerous cook-offs, with over 300 pizzas shipped. I am trained in heavy pastry-making and I’m the toughest dough tosser
                in the entire Canadian Cooking Corps. You are nothing to me but just another customer.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI will wipe you the pepperoni out with taste the likes of which has never been
                seen before in this kitchen, mark my garlic bread. You think you can get away with cooking microwave pizzas? Think again, pleb. As we speak I am contacting my network of
                sous-chefs across Canada and your recipe is being traced right now so you better prepare for the deep-dish, dough boy. The dish that wipes out the pathetic little thing you
                call your entree. Your pizza tastes like buttered toast, kid.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI can be anywhere, anytime, and I can out cook you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s without my mum. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed cooking, but I have
                access to the entire pantry of the Canadian Cooking Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable pizza off the face of the continent, you second-rate
                dish-hand. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” recipe was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have stopped cooking. But you
                wouldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you untrained Iron Chef reject. I will show your tastebuds my fury and you will drown in garlic bread.
                <br><br>
                Get ready to eat healthy and enjoy it.
